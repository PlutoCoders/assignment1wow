# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

Welcome to my first assignment! 

What I did

## In this assignment, I have adjusted many things within the code of both the index.html file, as well as the style.css file in the assets folder so that the code is cleaner and more accesible than when I found it.

What was done:
- removal of duplicate code and consolidating in the style.css file.
- Adding alt text into the image lines of code within the index.html file so that the page is more accessible
- As a personal preference, I spaced out various part of the code within the index.html file so that it is slighty easier on the eyes when viewing and distinguishing between categories/sections.
- I've adjusted some elements within the index.html file so that they appear in a standard uniform layout, such as things within the <div>, and image anchors so that they appear stacked under the div/<a href> as opposed to in a long line that's hard to read.
